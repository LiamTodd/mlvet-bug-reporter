# mlvet-bug-reporter
NextJS server for bug reporting

This repository contains the code for a NextJS server hosted using Vercel, used to create GitHub issues on the MLVETDevelopers/MLVET repository on behalf of users.

Pushes to the main branch of this repository trigger an automatic redeployment of the server on Vercel.
